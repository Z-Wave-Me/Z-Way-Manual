\end {itemize}
\end {itemize}

\section{Instances}

Each device may have multiple instances (similar functions like switches, same type sensors, ...) If only one instance 
is present the id of this instance is 0. Command classes are located in instances only-

\begin {itemize}
\item Description: list of instances

\item Child objects
\begin {itemize}
\item [m]: instance object

\item Data: data object of instance 
\begin {itemize}
\item dynamic: flag if instance is dynamic

\item specificType: specific Z-Wave device class of instance
\end {itemize}
\end {itemize}
\end {itemize}

\subsection{CommandClass}

This is the command class object. It contains public methods and public data elements that are described
in chapter \ref{ccs}

\begin {itemize}
\item Description: Command Class Implementation

\end {itemize}
\item name: Command Class name
\item {Method}: Command Class method - see chapter \ref{ccs} for details.
\end {itemize}
\end {itemize}

\section{Data}

This is the description of the data object.

General note: Z-Way objects and it's decendents are NOT simple JS objects, but native JS objects, 
that does not allow object modification.

\begin {itemize}
\item name: Name of data tree element
\item updated: Update time
\item invalidated: Invalidate time
\item valueOf(): Returns value of the object (can be omitted to get object value)
\item invalidate(): Invalidate data value (mark is as not valid anymore)
\item bind(function (type[, arg]) {...}, [arg, [watchChildren=false]]): Bind function to a change of data tree element of its descendants
\item unbind(function): Unbind function bind previously with bind()
\end {itemize}
