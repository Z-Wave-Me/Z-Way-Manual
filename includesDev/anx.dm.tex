\chapter{\zway Data Model Reference}
\label{annexdatamodel}

\section{Data}

This is the description of the data object (called Data Holder or DH).

General note: \zway objects and it's decendents are NOT simple JS objects, but native 
JS objects, that does not allow object modification.

\begin {itemize}
\item name: Name of data tree element
\item updated: Update time
\item invalidated: Invalidate time
\item valueOf(): Returns value of the object (can be omitted to get object value)
\item invalidate(): Invalidate data value (mark is as not valid anymore)
\item bind(function (type[, arg]) {...}, [arg, [watchChildren=false]]): Bind function 
to a change of data tree element of its descendants
\item unbind(function): Unbind function bind previously with bind()
\end {itemize}


\section{JS object zway}

\begin {itemize}
\item Description: zway is the Z-Wave part of the object tree

data object zway.controller.
