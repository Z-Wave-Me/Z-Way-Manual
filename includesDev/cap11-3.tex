\label{jsapi}

combines them with the ability to run JavaScript code on top of the
Z-Wave Device functions and variables.}{The JavaScript API mirrors all functions of the Z-Wave device API and combines them with the ability to run JavaScript code on top of the Z-Wave Device functions and variables.}

There are two ways to run JavaScript functions in Z-Way.
\begin{itemize}
\item \change{They can be executed in the web browser URL string (using /JS/Run/ prefix)
\item They can be implemented as module running in the backend or be stored in a file on the server side.}{They can be executed in the web browser URL string (using /JS/Run/ prefix)
\item They can be implemented as module running in the backend or be stored in a file on the server side.}
\end{itemize}
\change{Both options have their pros and cons. Running JS code in the browser is a very nice
and convenient way to test things but the function is not persistent.

Writing a module requires some more knowledge and debugging is more complicated.
On the other hand the possibilities of JavaScript in the module are almost infinite
and goes far beyond just accessing Z-Wave device. JavaScript as any other language
can make use of services available in the Internet and combine them in any possible
way with information from the Z-Wave network and can execute functions within
the Z-Wave network but the same time on any place accessible via Internet based
services. In theory there is not even a need to have Z-Wave device in order to make
use of the powerful JavaScript engine. As an example you can write a JavaScript
module polling weather data from the internet and depending on certain well defined
conditions the same module can send you a short message on your mobile.
Both functions are by the way already implemented as open source modules and can be
accessed and studied for further modification or use.}{Both options have their pros and cons. Running JS code in the browser is a very nice and convenient way to test things but the function is not persistent.

\subsection {The JavaScript Engine}

\change{Z-Way uses the JavaScript engine provided by Google referred to as V8. You find more
information about this JavaScript implementation on https://code.google.com/p/v8/.
V8 implements JavaScript according to the specification ECMA 5
\footnote {http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm}.

Z-Way extends the basic functionality provided by V8 with plenty of application
specific functions.}{Z-Way uses the JavaScript engine provided by Google referred to as V8. You find more information about this JavaScript implementation on https://code.google.com/p/v8/.

\subsection{Accessing the JS API}

The JS API can be accessed from any web browser with the URL

\paragraph{http://YOURIP:8083/JS/Run/*}

\change{All functions of the Z-Wave Device API can be used by JavaScript. They are encapsulated
in the 'zway' object.  This object has the same structure as defined in annex

\paragraph{http://YOURIP:8083/JS/Run/zway.devices[x].*}

\change{Due to the scripting nature of JavaScript its possible to 'inject' code at run time
using the interface. Here a nice example how to use the Java Script
setInterval function:}{Owing to the scripting nature of JavaScript, it’s possible to ``inject’’ code at run time using the interface. Here a nice example how to use the Java Script setInterval function:}

\begin{listingverbatim}[Polling device \#2]

	zway.devices[2].Basic.Get();
}, 300*1000);
\end{listingverbatim}

\change{This code will, once 'executed' as URL within a web browser, call the Get() command
of the command class Basic of Node ID 2 every 300 seconds.

A very powerful function of the JS API is the ability to bind functions to certain
values of the device tree. they get then executed when the value changes. Here an
example for this binding. The device No. 3 has a command class SensorMultilevel that offers
the variable level. The following call - both available on the client side
and on the server side - will bind a simple alert function to the change of
the variable.}{This code will, once ``executed’’ as a URL within a web browser, calls the Get() command of the command class Basic of Node ID 2 every 300 seconds.

\subsection{HTTP Access}

The JavaScript implementation of Z-Way \change{allows to directly accessing HTTP objects.

The http request is much like jQuery.ajax(): r = http.request(options);

To start communications one need to create socket and either
\textbf{connect} it or \textbf{listen} it. \textbf{onrecv} method is called
on data receive from remote, while \textbf{send} is used to send data to remote side.

sock.bind(8888);

sock.onrecv = function(data) {

Detailed description of Socket API:
\begin{itemize}
\change{\item bind(ip, port) or bind(port) binds socket to port (integer number). ip should be a string like "192.168.0.1". If omited "0.0.0.0" is used (bind on all IP addresses of all interfaces). Returns false on error.
\item connect(ip, port) connects to remote side ip:port. TCP sockets requires this call before sending data. For UDP sockets it is optional, but once used allows to use send call instead of sendto call. Returns false on error.
\item listen() starts listening port (this is required not only for TCP, but for UDP too). Returns false on error.
\item close() initiate close of socket.
\item send(data) sends data to connected or accepted socket.
\item sendto(data, host, port) sends data to a non-connected UDP socket.
\item onrecv(data, host, port) called on new data receiption from remote side. For UDP sockets and connected TCP sockets "this" object reffers to the socket itself, while for accepted TCP sockets "this" reffers to the client's individual objects.
\item onconnect(remoteHost, remotePort, localHost, localPort) called only for TCP sockets on new connection accept. "this" reffers to the client individual socket object.
\item onclose(remoteHost, remotePort, localHost, localPort) called on socket close by remote or due to close() call. Note that for TCP sockets this callback is called for client sockets on connection close and for binded listening socket if close() is called. "this" object will be defined like in onrecv.
\item reusable() sets SO\_REUSEADDR socket option to allow multiple bind() on the same port.
\item broadcast() sets SO\_BROADCAST socket option to allow sending broadcast UDP messages.

\item onerror(event) called on error. For example, host or port unreachable. Note that new sockets.websocket(..) can throw an exception on DNS resolution error or on network unreachable. Other errors will be reported via onerror. Parameter event contains only propery data. Other properties from RFC 6455 are not implemented.}

\subsection{Other JavaScript Extensions}

\subsubsection{fs.list(folder)}

\annote{This returns list of items in the folder or undefined if not folder is not existing.}{The meaning is not clear.}


\subsubsection{fs.stat(file)}

This returns one of the following values:

\begin{itemize}
\item 1) undefined if object does not exist or not readable
\item 2) object \{ type: 'file', size: \textless{}size\textgreater{}\} if it is a file
\item 3) object \{ type: 'dir' \} if it is a folder
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{fs.loadJSON(filename)}

\change{This function reads a file from the file system and loads it into the memory. The file must contain a valid JSON object. The only argument is the name of the file including relative pathname to the automation folder. The functions returns the full JSON object or null in case of error.}{This function reads a file from the file system and loads it into the memory. The file must contain a valid JSON object.

\subsubsection{executeFile(filename) and executeJS(string)}

\change{Loads and executes a particular JavaScript file from the local filesystem or executes JavaScript code represented in string (like eval in browsers).

The script is executed withig the global namespace.

Remark: If an error occurred during the execution it won't stop from further execution, but erroneous script will not be executed completely. It will stop on the first error.
Exceptions in the callee can be trapped in the caller using standard try-catch mechanism.}{Loads and executes a particular JavaScript file from the local filesystem or executes JavaScript code represented in string (like eval in browsers).

\subsubsection{system(command)}

\change{The command system() allows to execute any shell level command available on the operating
system. It will return the shell output of the command.  On default the execution of
system commands is forbidden. Each command executed need to be permitted by putting one
line with the starting commands in the file automation/.syscommands or in an different
automation folder as specified in config.xml.}{The command system() allows executing any shell level command available on the operating system. It will return the shell output of the command.

\subsubsection{Timers}
\change{Timers are implemented exactly as they are used in browsers. They are very helpfull for periodical and delayed operations. Timeout/period is defined in milliseconds.}{Timers are implemented exactly as they are used in browsers. They are very helpful for periodical and delayed operations.

\begin{itemize}
\item timerId = setTimeout(function() { }, timeout)
\item timerId = setInterval(function() { }, period)
\item clearTimeout(timerId)
\item clearInterval(timerId)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{loadObject(object\_name) and saveObject(object\_name, object)}
\change{Loads and saves JSON object from/to storage. These functions implements flat storage for application with access to the object by it's name. No folders are available.

Data is saved in automation/storage folder. Filenames are made from object names by stripping characters but [a-ZA-Z0-9] and adding checksum from original name (to avoid name conflicts).}{Loads and saves JSON object from/to storage.

\subsubsection{exit()}
Stops JavaScript engine and shuts down Z-Way server


\subsubsection{allowExternalAccess(handlerName) and listExternalAccess()}
\change{allowExternalAccess allows to register HTTP handler. handlerName can contain strings like aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd - in that case any HTTP request starting by /aaa/bbb/ccc/ddd will be handled by a function aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd() if present, otherwise aaa.bbb.ccc(), ... up to aaa().
Handler should return object with at least properties status and body (one can also specify headers like it was in http.request module).

listExternalAccess returns array with names of all registered HTTP handlers.

Here is an example how to attach handlers for /what/timeisit and /what:}{allowExternalAccess allows registering the HTTP handler. handlerName can contain strings like aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd---in that case any HTTP request starting by /aaa/bbb/ccc/ddd will be handled by a function aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd() if present, otherwise aaa.bbb.ccc(), ... up to aaa().

\subsubsection{debugPrint(object, object, ...)}

\change{Prints arguments converted to string to Z-Way console. Very usefull for debuggin.
For convenience one can map 'console.log()' to debugPrint().

This is how it was done in automation/main.js in Z-Way Home Automation engine:}{Prints arguments converted to string to Z-Way console. Very useful for debugging. For convenience, one can map ``console.log()’’ to debugPrint().

    log: debugPrint,
    warn: debugPrint,
    error: debugPrint,
    debug: debugPrint,
    logJS: function() {
        var arr = [];

            arr.push(JSON.stringify(arguments[key]));
        debugPrint(arr);
    }
};
\end{listingverbatim}

\subsection{Debugging JavaScript code}
Change in config.xml debug-port to 8183 (or some other) turn on V8 debugger capability on Z-Way start.

\begin{listingverbatim}
<config>
    ...
    <debug-port>8183</debug-port>
    ....
</config>
\end{listingverbatim}

\change{node-inspector debugger tool is required. It provides web-based UI for debugging similar to Google Chrome debug console.

You might want to run debugger tool on another machine (for example if it is not possible to install it on the same box as Z-Way is running on).

Use the following command to forward debugger port defined in config.xml to your local machine:}{node-inspector debugger tool is required. It provides web-based UI for debugging similar to Google Chrome debug console.

Then you can connect to http://IP\_OF\_MACHINE\_WITH\_NODE\_INSPECTOR:8080/debug?port=8183

\change{If debugging is turned on, Z-Way gives you 5 seconds during startup to reconnect debugger to Z-Way (refresh the page of debugger Web UI withing these 5 seconds).
This allows you to debug startup code of Z-Way JavaScript engine from the very first line of code.}{If debugging is turned on, Z-Way gives you five seconds during startup to reconnect debugger to Z-Way (refresh the page of debugger Web UI within these five seconds).
