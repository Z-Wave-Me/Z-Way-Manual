\chapter{Command Class Reference}
\label{ccs}


Command Classes are groups of wireless commands that allow using certain functions of a Z-Wave device.  
In Z-Way each Z-Wave device has a data holder entry for each Command Class supported. During the inclusion 
and interview of the device the Command Class structure is instantiated in the data holder and filled with 
certain data. Command Class commands change values of the corresponding data holder structure. The follow 
list shows the public commands of the Command Classes supported with their parameters and the data holder 
objects changed.

In Expert UI navigate to Expert tab under Configuration page of a device to execute commands of the supported Command Classes and visualizes all data holder elements in as tree in a simplified UI.
